Influence of 17α-ethinylestradiol on DNA Methylation in Oysters

M.R. Gavery and S.B. Roberts

Introduction 
Endocrine disrupting compounds are emerging environmental contaminants that threaten water quality and health of humans and wildlife worldwide. These compounds, many with structural similarities to hormones such as estrogen, affect endocrine pathways and can cause reproductive perturbations. These compounds enter aquatic ecosystems through a variety of sources including wastewater treatments facilities, septic systems, and industrial effluents.  While physiological effects of endocrine disruption have been described, it is becoming evident that our understanding of the biological pathways affected are incomplete and that alternative modes of action need to be explored.  One compound of concern is 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), the active constituent of the female contraceptive pill, has been reported at high concentrations in aquatic environments.  Data collected in 1999 – 2000, from US streams in 30 states, reported concentrations of EE2 between 5 and 273 ng/L (Kolpin et al. 2002).27  Effects of EE2 exposure include delayed sexual development, induction of vitellogenesis and feminization of males in both fish and bivalves (Schultz et al. 2003; Andrew et al. 2010).28, 29  However, mechanisms underlying the response of bivalves is unclear.
