                 microarrays (ChIP-chip) is a high-throughput assay for
                 DNA-protein-binding or post-translational chromatin/histone
                 modifications. However, the raw microarray intensity readings
                 themselves are not immediately useful to researchers, but
                 require a number of bioinformatic analysis steps. Identified
                 enriched regions need to be bioinformatically annotated and
                 compared to related datasets by statistical methods. RESULTS:
                 We present a free, open-source R package Ringo that
                 facilitates the analysis of ChIP-chip experiments by providing
                 functionality for data import, quality assessment,
                 normalization and visualization of the data, and the detection
                 of ChIP-enriched genomic regions. CONCLUSION: Ringo integrates
                 with other packages of the Bioconductor project, uses common
                 data structures and is accompanied by ample documentation. It
                 facilitates the construction of programmed analysis workflows,
                 offers benefits in scalability, reproducibility and methodical

                 occurrence of pharmaceuticals, hormones, and other organic
                 wastewater contaminants (OWCs) in water resources, the U.S.
                 Geological Survey used five newly developed analytical methods
                 to measure concentrations of 95 OWCs in water samples from a
                 network of 139 streams across 30 states during 1999 and 2000.
                 The selection of sampling sites was biased toward streams
                 susceptible to contamination (i.e. downstream of intense
                 urbanization and livestock production). OWCs were prevalent
                 during this study, being found in 80\% of the streams sampled.
                 The compounds detected represent a wide range of residential,
                 industrial, and agricultural origins and uses with 82 of the
                 95 OWCs being found during this study. The most frequently
                 detected compounds were coprostanol (fecal steroid),
                 cholesterol (plant and animal steroid), N,N-diethyltoluamide
                 (insect repellant), caffeine (stimulant), triclosan
                 (antimicrobial disinfectant), tri(2-chloroethyl)phosphate
                 (fire retardant), and 4-nonylphenol (nonionic detergent
                 metabolite). Measured concentrations for this study were
                 generally low and rarely exceeded drinking-water guidelines,
                 drinking-water health advisories, or aquatic-life criteria.
                 Many compounds, however, do not have such guidelines
                 established. The detection of multiple OWCs was common for
                 this study, with a median of seven and as many as 38 OWCs
                 being found in a given water sample. Little is known about the
                 potential interactive effects (such as synergistic or
                 antagonistic toxicity) that may occur from complex mixtures of
                 OWCs in the environment. In addition, results of this study
                 demonstrate the importance of obtaining data on metabolites to
                 fully understand not only the fate and transport of OWCs in

              tissues, the immune system in particular. In mammalian
              immunocytes, 17$\beta$-estradiol (E2) has both dose- and
              cell-type specific effects and the responses to E2 seem to be
              mediated by rapid, non-genomic mechanisms; these may be initiated
              at either membrane or cytosolic locations, and can result in both
              direct local effects, such as modification of ion fluxes, and
              regulation of gene transcription secondary to activation of
              different kinase cascades, including mitogen activated protein
              kinases (MAPKs). In this work, the short-term effects of E2 and
              the possible mechanisms of estrogen-mediated cell signaling were
              investigated in the hemocytes, the immune cells of the bivalve
              mollusc, the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis Lam. The results
              show that E2 (25 nM) caused a rapid and significant increase in
              hemocyte cytosolic [Ca2+]; lower concentrations (5 nM) showed a
              smaller, not significant effect. Both E2 concentrations affected
              the phosphorylation state of the components of tyrosine
              kinase-mediated signal transduction MAPK- and STAT- (signal
              transducers and activators of transcription) like proteins within
              5--15 min from E2 addition. A greater effect and clearer time
              course were observed with 25 nM E2: in particular, E2 induced a
              transient increase in p-ERK2 MAPK and a persistent increase in
              p-p38 MAPK. Moreover, both STAT3 and STAT5 were tyrosine
              phosphorylated in response to E2. E2 (5 nM) induced both
              morphological (as evaluated by SEM) and functional changes (such
              as extracellular release of hydrolytic enzymes, lysosomal
              membrane destabilisation, and stimulation of the bactericidal
              activity) within 10--30 min from addition. Lysosomal membrane
              destabilisation induced by both E2 concentrations was abolished
              by hemocyte preincubation with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580,
              and significantly reduced by PD98059 and Wortmannin (inhibitors
              of ERK MAPK and PI3-K, respectively), this suggesting that rapid
              activation of kinase cascades is involved in mediating the
              effects of E2 in mussel hemocytes. The antiestrogen Tamoxifen
              prevented or strongly reduced most, but not all, the effects of
              E2. Western blotting with heterologous
              anti-ER$\alpha$--anti-ER$\beta$-antibodies revealed the presence
              of immunoreactive ER$\alpha$- and ER$\beta$-like proteins in
              hemocyte protein extracts. Overall, our data support the
              hypothesis that the rapid effects and mechanisms of action of
              17$\beta$-estradiol are extremely conserved and that they may
              play a crucial role in endocrine--immune interactions in

              optimum stage of gonadal development and the efficiency of larval
              culture may be substantially improved by using only optimally
              conditioned broodstock. The conditioning requirement to bring
              broodstock into this optimum stage is dependent upon the stage of
              gonadal development at the commencement of conditioning and upon
              the rate of conditioning. The stage of gonadal development at the
              commencement of conditioning may be determined directly or
              inferred by understanding the annual cycle of gonadal development
              occurring in the broodstock. The rate of conditioning, on the
              other hand, is regulated by the conditioning environment. In the
              present study, we have observed the influence of three components
              of the conditioning environment: temperature, salinity, and
              supplemental feeding on the rate of gonadal development during
              hatchery conditioning of broodstock. The rate of gonadal
              development is a function of temperature intensity and time
              rather than accumulated thermal exposure. Salinity exerted a
              negative influence on the rate of development in oysters
              conditioned at salinity levels below 30 parts per thousand (ppt).
              Furthermore, when oysters conditioned at 20 ppt relative to 30
              ppt were spawned and the larvae were reared under standardized
              hatchery conditions, larval survival was markedly reduced in the
              former. Fecundity of broodstock was 60\% greater when fed an
              algal food supplement of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana
              relative to starved controls, although the rate of gonadal
              development and gamete viability was not significantly different.
              Using these empirically determined functions, a simplistic
              quatitative model may be employed to predict broodstock
              conditioning requirements in order to increase the proportion of
              optimally conditioned brood oysters.",

                 the tissue level of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM),

                 It is therefore proposed that the organotins hypomethylation

               fertilization to determine the proportion that attained the eyed

               Exposure to lower EE2 water concentrations (10 and 100 ng/L)
               caused an increase in sperm density, while a significant

                 a gene or in its 5' flanking region influences the gene

                 eukaryotes are mostly found on cytosine bases located 5' to

  abstract  = "In assessing the evidence as to whether vertebrate sex steroids
               (e.g. testosterone, estradiol, progesterone) have hormonal
               actions in mollusks, ca. 85\% of research papers report at least
               one biological effect; and 18 out of 21 review papers (published
               between 1970 and 2012) express a positive view. However, just
               under half of the research studies can be rejected on the
               grounds that they did not actually test steroids, but compounds
               or mixtures that were only presumed to behave as steroids (or
               modulators of steroids) on the basis of their effects in
               vertebrates (e.g. Bisphenol-A, nonylphenol and sewage treatment
               effluents). Of the remaining 55 papers, some can be criticized
               for having no statistical analysis; some for using only a single
               dose of steroid; others for having irregular dose-response
               curves; 40 out of the 55 for not replicating the treatments; and
               50 out of 55 for having no within-study repetition. Furthermore,
               most studies had very low effect sizes in comparison to
               fish-based bioassays for steroids (i.e. they had a very weak
               'signal-to-noise' ratio). When these facts are combined with the
               fact that none of the studies were conducted with rigorous
               randomization or 'blinding' procedures (implying the possibility
               of 'operator bias') one must conclude that there is no
               indisputable bioassay evidence that vertebrate sex steroids have
               endocrinological or reproductive roles in mollusks. The only
               observation that has been independently validated is the ability
               of estradiol to trigger rapid (1-5 min) lysosomal membrane
               breakdown in hemocytes of Mytilus spp. This is a typical
               'inflammatory' response, however, and is not proof that
               estradiol is a hormone - especially when taken in conjunction
               with the evidence (discussed in a previous review) that mollusks
               have neither the enzymes necessary to synthesize vertebrate
               steroids nor nuclear receptors with which to respond to them.",

                 modifications, such as DNA methylation, that influence adult
                 disease susceptibility. In utero or neonatal exposure to
                 bisphenol A (BPA), a high-production-volume chemical used in
                 the manufacture of polycarbonate plastic, is associated with
                 higher body weight, increased breast and prostate cancer, and
                 altered reproductive function. This study shows that maternal
                 exposure to this endocrine-active compound shifted the coat
                 color distribution of viable yellow agouti (Avy) mouse
                 offspring toward yellow by decreasing CpG (cytosine-guanine
                 dinucleotide) methylation in an intracisternal A particle
                 retrotransposon upstream of the Agouti gene. CpG methylation
                 also was decreased at another metastable locus, the CDK5
                 activator-binding protein (CabpIAP). DNA methylation at the
                 Avy locus was similar in tissues from the three germ layers,
                 providing evidence that epigenetic patterning during early
                 stem cell development is sensitive to BPA exposure. Moreover,
                 maternal dietary supplementation, with either methyl donors
                 like folic acid or the phytoestrogen genistein, negated the
                 DNA hypomethylating effect of BPA. Thus, we present compelling
                 evidence that early developmental exposure to BPA can change
                 offspring phenotype by stably altering the epigenome, an
                 effect that can be counteracted by maternal dietary

                 the temporal nature of the vitellogenin response with
                 continual exposure is currently lacking for biomarker utility.
                 To address this knowledge gap, adult Sydney rock oysters,
                 Saccostrea glomerata, were exposed to a range of
                 environmentally relevant concentrations of
                 17$\alpha$-ethynylestradiol (EE2) (0, 6.25, 12.5, 25 or 50
                 ng/l) in seawater under laboratory conditions. Vitellogenin
                 induction and gonadal development was assessed following 4, 21
                 and 49 days exposure to EE2. Vitellogenin was found to
                 increase in a dose dependent manner with EE2 exposure for
                 females (4 and 49 days) and males (4 and 21 days).
                 Histological examination of gonads revealed a number of
                 individuals exhibited intersex (ovotestis) in 50 ng/l EE2
                 (after 21 days) and in 6.25 and 12.5 ng/l EE2 (after 49 days).
                 Furthermore, a significant shift towards females was observed
                 following 49 days exposure at 50 ng/l EE2 suggesting
                 estrogenic exposure is capable of facilitating a progression
                 for protandric males from male-intersex-female gametal status.
                 Increases in female vitellogenin (4 days) were predictive of
                 later increases in female developmental stages at 21 days and
                 increases in oocyte area following 49 days. Male vitellogenin
                 (4 days) was predictive of decreased male percentages and
                 lower male developmental stages at 49 days. Vitellogenin in S.
                 glomerata is a predictive biomarker of estrogenic exposure and

                 17beta-estradiol (17beta-E(2)) from M. edulis ganglionic
                 tissue, we confirmed the presence of 17beta-E(2) by RIA and
                 ES-Q-TOF-MS analysis. We further found that when either
                 exogenous or endogenous (purified HPLC fraction) 17beta-E(2)
                 was added to pedal ganglia, there was immediate
                 concentration-dependent NO release. Furthermore, 17beta-E(2)
                 conjugated to BSA also stimulated NO release, suggesting
                 mediation by a membrane surface receptor. Tamoxifen, an
                 estrogen receptor antagonist, inhibited the action of both
                 17beta-E(2) and 17beta-E(2) conjugated to BSA, further
                 supporting the presence of an estrogen receptor. In addition,
                 by Western blot analysis with anti-ER-beta antibodies, we
                 observed a 55-kDa protein in both the membrane and cytosolic
                 fractions in pedal ganglia as well as in human leukocytes
                 (that have been previously shown to express ER-beta). In
                 summary, our results suggest that a physiological dose of
                 estrogen acutely stimulates NO release within pedal ganglia
